Introduction

The Lisp Unix-Like Kernel project explores the potential of using Lisp for systems programming, traditionally dominated by languages like C. By harnessing Lisp's powerful macro system, dynamic typing, and garbage collection, this project aims to create a secure and efficient operating system kernel. The kernel focuses on a microkernel architecture to enhance modularity and security.

Design and Architecture

Our kernel is built on a microkernel architecture, minimizing the amount of code running in privileged mode. Core functionalities like memory management, process management, and inter-process communication (IPC) are handled within the microkernel, while higher-level services such as filesystems and device drivers operate in user space.

Key Components
kernel.lisp: Core implementation of the microkernel, managing system initialization, memory, processes, and IPC.
memory.lisp: Handles dynamic memory allocation, garbage collection, and memory protection mechanisms.
scheduler.lisp: Implements preemptive, priority-based process scheduling.
ipc.lisp: Manages various IPC mechanisms, ensuring secure and efficient communication between processes.
filesystem.lisp: Supports multiple filesystem types with advanced features like journaling and deduplication.
network.c: Implements the networking stack for optimal performance.
nic.c: Manages Network Interface Controller operations and hardware interactions.
Security Considerations

Security is paramount in our design. The microkernel architecture enhances security by isolating critical components. We incorporate features like Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), stack canaries, and a robust permission system to protect against common vulnerabilities. Regular security audits and adherence to best practices ensure ongoing resilience against threats.

Performance Optimization

Despite Lisp's high-level abstractions, our kernel employs several optimization techniques to ensure competitive performance:

Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation: Translates Lisp code to efficient machine code at runtime.
Efficient Memory Management: Utilizes advanced garbage collection and memory pooling techniques.
Multi-Core Support: Leverages parallel processing capabilities of modern hardware.
Development Tools and Environment

We use Quicklisp for dependency management and SBCL (Steel Bank Common Lisp) for its robust performance and debugging tools. Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines automate the build and testing process, ensuring code stability. Version control with Git and comprehensive documentation support collaboration and maintainability.

Memory Management

Memory management is handled by a sophisticated garbage collector tailored for real-time systems. Features include incremental and concurrent collection, memory protection, and efficient handling of fragmentation.

Inter-Process Communication (IPC)

Our kernel supports multiple IPC methods including message passing, shared memory, and semaphores, with security features like encryption and authentication to ensure data integrity and confidentiality.

Process Scheduling

The kernel uses a preemptive, priority-based scheduling algorithm with support for real-time, interactive, and batch processing. Dynamic priority adjustments and multi-core scheduling enhance performance and responsiveness.

Filesystem

The kernel supports traditional and modern filesystems, ensuring high performance and reliability. Features like journaling, copy-on-write, and access control mechanisms are integrated to provide robust and secure data storage.

Network Stack Functionality

The networking stack, implemented in C, manages protocol handling and packet processing for efficient communication. The NIC layer handles low-level hardware interactions, ensuring reliable data transmission.

Compilation and Deployment

Our automated CI/CD pipeline ensures consistent and reliable compilation, testing, and deployment of the kernel. The process includes code integration, build automation, unit testing, and deployment to various environments.

Advantages and Challenges

Advantages
Flexibility and Modularity: Lisp's macro system and meta-programming capabilities allow for highly modular and reusable code.
Security: High-level abstractions and memory safety features reduce common vulnerabilities.
Developer Productivity: Interactive development environment and high-level syntax enhance productivity.
Challenges
Performance Overhead: Requires optimization to meet performance expectations.
Expertise Scarcity: Limited Lisp expertise in systems programming.
Compatibility: Challenges in porting existing software to a Lisp-based environment.
Getting Started

Prerequisites
Quicklisp
SBCL
Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Keefereeves1/Lisp-Unix-Like-Kernel.git
cd Lisp-Unix-Like-Kernel

Install dependencies:

sbcl --load quicklisp.lisp

Build the kernel:


./build.sh


Reasons its not finished yet:
I havn't managed to compile the kernel.lisp file yet, theres something wrong with the systemarea pointers that wont allow it to compile, i think the issue is i need to change 
it to Clli system area pointers, rather then the alien system area pointers. Also i the build doesnt include all the files as of yet, im slowly working on compiling all the files
there are a few files that dont exist yet that are going to need to exist. Such as security.lisp, application.lisp and network.c, and those need to integrate, and i havnt mapped
out how im going to compile the shell and what format yet, but everything else that is listed as a compilation in the build.sh will compile except kernel.c. 

I have more written documentation on this. please see the file LispUnixKernel.docx, as that is comprehensive in the plan to go about this

Thanks!

(side note, i have changed the custom alien functions in kernel.lisp to clli functions, but i have yet to test them)
